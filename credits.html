<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has guided me through my own ECG learning journey --
  the senior residents, fellows, and attendings who walked me through their techniques,
  and alerted me of clinical pearls from their own experiences.
  I hope I will make you proud.</p>
<p>A special thanks to those in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/foamed">#FOAMed</a> (free open access medical education) movement,
 who believe in this cause, and from whom I continue to learn from every day.</p>
