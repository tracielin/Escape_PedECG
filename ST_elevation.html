<h1>
<span>Dr. Stelev</span>
<span>was an esteemed</span>
<span>pediatric cardiologist</span>
<span>back in the day.</span><br>
<span>Until, that is,</span>
<span>one too many fellows told him what an ECG automated read said</span>
<span>about the ST segments before examining the waveforms themselves.</span><br>
<span><b>The horror!</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>Now he spends his days casting unsuspecting residents and fellows into a dungeon...</span><br>
<span>Their one escape being a series of elevators...</span>
<span>activated only by</span>
<span>correctly distinguishing concerning ST segment changes versus likely normal variants.</span>
