<p class = "scenario"> Dr. Stelev was an esteemed pediatric electrophysiologist back in the day.
  <br>Until, that is, one too many fellows told him what an ECG automated read said about the ST segments
  <br>before examining the ECG themselves. (The horror!)</p>
  <p class="scenario">Now he spends his days casting unsuspecting residents and fellows into a dungeon...
  <br>Their one escape being a series of elevators...activated only by
  <br>correctly distinguishing concerning ST segment changes versus likely normal variants. </p>
